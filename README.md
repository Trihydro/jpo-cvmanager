## Release Notes

The current version and release history of the JPO CV Manager: [Release Notes](docs/Release_notes.md)

## Requirements and Limitations

The JPO CV Manager was originally developed for the Google Cloud Platform and a few of its GCP dependencies still remain. The GCP dependencies will eventually be streamlined to support other options. However, there are a handful of technologies to know before attempting to utilize the CV Manager.

### CV Manager Webapp

- Supports OAuth2.0 through Keycloak for user authentication only. It can be configured for several different Identity Providers, including Google.

### CV Manager API

- PostgreSQL database is required. Run the [table creation script to create a to-spec database](resources/sql_scripts).
  - Follow along with the README to ensure your data is properly populated before running the CV Manager.
- GCP BigQuery is required to support J2735 message counts and BSM data. Message counts will be migrated to PostgreSQL eventually, however it is not recommended to store full J2735 messages in a PostgreSQL database. A noSQL database or a database that is specialized for storing big data is recommended. Support for MongoDB is planned to be implemented.
  - It is recommended to create a table for storing J2735 messages, one table per message type (BSM, MAP, SPaT, SRM, and SSM), before running the CV Manager.

### Keycloak

- Keycloak is used for the CV Manager webapp's authentication.
- The Keycloak pod requires a `realm.json` file in the folder: `./resources/keycloak/` to startup with the proper configurations. It also requires a login theme that can be modified and generated using the [keycloakify](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify) forked repository in resources/keycloak/keycloakify. The theme will be automatically generated when using the docker image provided but can also be built using instructions found in the keycloakify folder.

## Getting Started

The following steps are intended to help get a new user up and running the JPO CV Manager in their own environment.

1.  Follow the Requirements and Limitations section and make sure all requirements are met.
2.  Create a copy of the sample.env named ".env" and refer to the Environmental variables section below for more information on each variable.
    1.  Make sure at least the DOCKER_HOST_IP, KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD, KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_SECRET_KEY, and MAPBOX_TOKEN are set for this.
3.  The CV Manager has four components that need to be containerized and deployed: the API, the PostgreSQL database, Keycloak, and the webapp.

    - If you are looking to deploy the CV Manager locally, you can simply run the docker-compose, make sure to fill out the .env file to ensure it launches properly. Also, edit your host file ([How to edit the host file](<[resources/kubernetes](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/)>)) and add IP address of your docker host to these custom domains (remove the carrot brackets and just put the IP address):

    CV Manager hosts:

         <DOCKER_HOST_IP> cvmanager.local.com
         <DOCKER_HOST_IP> cvmanager.auth.com

4.  Apply the docker compose to start the required components:

         docker compose up -d

5.  Access the website by going to:

    ```
      http://cvmanager.local.com
      Default Username: test@gmail.com
      Default Password: tester
    ```

6.  To access keycloak go to:

    ```
      http://cvmanager.auth.com:8084/
      Default Username: admin
      Default Password: admin
    ```

- If you are looking to deploy in Kubernetes or on separate VMs, refer to the Kubernetes YAML deployment files to deploy the four components to your cluster. ([Kubernetes YAML](resources/kubernetes))

### Debugging

Note that it is recommended to work with the Python API from a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). 

#### Setting up a virtual environment from the command line
1. Verify that you have Python 3.12.2 installed on your machine by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python3.12 --version
    ```
    ```cmd
    python --version
    ```
    If you have a different version installed, download and install Python 3.12.2 from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment in the project root:
    ```bash
    python3.12 -m venv .venv
    ```
    ```cmd
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    ```cmd
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip3.12 install -r services/requirements.txt
    ```
    ```cmd
    pip install -r services/requirements.txt
    ```

#### Setting up a virtual environment with VSCode
See [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) documentation for information on how to set up a virtual environment with VS Code.

#### Debugging Profile
A debugging profile has been set up for use with VSCode to allow ease of debugging with this application. To use this profile, simply open the project in VSCode and select the "Debug" tab on the left side of the screen. Then, select the "Debug Solution" profile and click the green play button. This will spin up a postgresql instance as well as the keycloak auth solution within docker containers. Once running, this will also start the debugger and attach it to the running API container. You can then set breakpoints and step through the code as needed.

For the "Debug Solution" to run properly on Windows 10/11 using WSL, the following must be configured:

1.  In a Powershell or Command Prompt terminal run the command: `ifconfig` and open up your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file

    - Copy the `Ethernet adapter vEthernet (WSL) -> IPv4 Address` value to your hosts `cvmanager.auth.com` entry.
    - In the same hosts file, update the `cvmanager.local.com` value to: `127.0.0.1`.

2.  Update your main .env file variables as specified in the root of the cvmanager directory

    - Copy the `Ethernet adapter vEthernet (Default) -> IPv4 Address` value to your hosts `WEBAPP_HOST_IP` variable

3.  Apply the docker compose to start the required components:

         docker compose up -d

4.  Access the website by going to:

    ```
      http://cvmanager.local.com
      Default Username: test@gmail.com
      Default Password: tester
    ```

5.  To access keycloak go to:

    ```
      http://cvmanager.auth.com:8084/
      Default Username: admin
      Default Password: admin
    ```
