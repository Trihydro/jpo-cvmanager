## About <a name = "about"></a>

This directory contains two microservices that run within the CV Manager GKE Cluster. Both the 'rsu_ping_fetch' and 'rsu_pinger' applications populate the CV Manager PostGreSQL database's 'ping' table with the current online statuses of all RSUs recorded in the 'rsus' table. For 'rsu_ping_fetch', these statuses are retrieved directly from a [Zabbix server](https://www.zabbix.com/). For 'rsu_pinger', these statuses are generated by pinging every RSU in the 'rsus' table every 1 minute.

If you have access to a Zabbix server that is tracking RSUs, it is recommended to use the 'rsu_ping_fetch' application. However, the 'rsu_pinger' is an effective alternative.

Another feature both applications provide is a ping data purger that will remove stale ping data from the CV Manager PostgreSQL database to allow for high performance RSU ping queries. The amount of time a message needs to be in the database to be considered stale is configurable with the STALE_PERIOD environment variable. This purger will run once every 24 hours to check for stale ping data in the database.

## Requirements <a name = "requirements"></a>

### rsu_ping_fetch

To properly run the rsu_ping_fetch microservice the following services are also required:

- CV Manager PostgreSQL database with at least one RSU inserted into the 'rsus' table
- Zabbix server with the REST API enabled
- rsu_ping_fetch must be deployed in the same environment or K8s cluster as the PostgreSQL database
- Network rules must be in place to allow proper routing between the rsu_ping_fetch microservice and the Zabbix server

The rsu_ping_fetch microservice expects the following environment variables to be set:

- ZABBIX_ENDPOINT - Zabbix API access endpoint.
- ZABBIX_USER - Zabbix API access username.
- ZABBIX_PASSWORD - Zabbix API access password.
- DB_USER - PostgreSQL access username.
- DB_PASS - PostgreSQL access password.
- DB_NAME - PostgreSQL database name.
- DB_HOST - PostgreSQL hostname, make sure to include port number.
- STALE_PERIOD - Number of hours a ping log needs to be around in the PostgreSQL database to be considered stale.
- LOGGING_LEVEL (optional, defaults to 'info')

### rsu_pinger

To properly run the rsu_pinger microservice the following services are also required:

- CV Manager PostgreSQL database with at least one RSU inserted into the 'rsus' table
- rsu_pinger must be deployed in the same environment or K8s cluster as the PostgreSQL database
- Network rules must be in place to allow proper routing between the rsu_pinger microservice and deployed RSUs

The rsu_pinger microservice expects the following environment variables to be set:

- DB_USER - PostgreSQL access username.
- DB_PASS - PostgreSQL access password.
- DB_NAME - PostgreSQL database name.
- DB_HOST - PostgreSQL hostname, make sure to include port number.
- STALE_PERIOD - Number of hours a ping log needs to be around in the PostgreSQL database to be considered stale.
- LOGGING_LEVEL (optional, defaults to 'info')
